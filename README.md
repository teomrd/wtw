  - Capture user input for the city
  - Extend the functionality to get forecast for more than one city

- State management with Redux
- Client side routing
- UX
  - Intoduce a design system (or build one)
  - Make it mobile friendly
  - Enrich the background of the app to represent the current weather conditions

* Code Quality and consistency

  - Enrich ESLint rules
    - eslint-plugin-airbnb
    - eslint-plugin-react
    - eslint-plugin-import
    - eslint-plugin-promise
    - eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
    - eslint-plugin-jest
    - eslint-plugin-prettier

  * Format code with Prettier
  * pre-commit hook that checks linting output and run the tests

* Project structure that better represents the applications structure
* Better Documentation on how to run, build test and extend the current functionality.
